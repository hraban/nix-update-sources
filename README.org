* Check for updates to Nix git sources

Given an entire Nix scope, find all git controlled source derivations that can be updated.

Purpose built tool for =lispPackagesLite=. I use this to see if any of the pinned packages in that scope have updates.

Usage:

#+begin_src shell
nix run --update-input hly-nixpkgs
#+end_src

This tool is a proof of concept. Feel free to use it, but I built this for myself to scratch an itch, not for public release.
